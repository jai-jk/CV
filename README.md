## Jai Jalah Kumar

I am a hungry, young entrepreneur who is looking to work with people who care about creating products that deliver genuine value to others. I have delivered consistently high customer satisfaction and business excellence through the use of effective customer service strategy, and internal cultural change projects.

I'm inspired by the ability to build and deliver powerful services, products and systems for our rapidly evolving civilisation, and the opportunity to be a leader in the most rapid and inclusive quality-of-life shift that humanity has ever experienced.

#### GCSEs and A Levels (Sep 2014 to June 2017)

- At Elutec: College of Design and Engineering:
   * Specific to Software Development - I achieved a high A (5 marks off of an A* !) in GCSE Maths, and a Distinction(A) - also, hilariously, 5 marks off of the highest mark, in the ICT Cambridge Nationals.
   * I also studied an Engineering Cambridge National but chose to discontinue it.

- At City and Islington Sixth Form College:
   * I studied the Creative Writing, Drama, and English Language and Literature A-Levels.
   * I left after year 12 to work and pursue independent learning. Due to the restructuring of A Levels in 2016, Creative Writing was the only subject of mine that could still be achieved as an AS Level. I achieved a B.

- I took part in a range of extra-curricular projects and awards throughout my GCSEs and A Levels:

   * I achieved Distinctions and Merits in the LAMDA acting exams, (Grades 5 - 8).
   * I took part in the BFI Film Academy and worked as a sound engineer and film editor on my group's short film.
   * I was selected to be part of the Roundhouse Talking Doorsteps program. I wrote and recorded a performance - about my experiences as an immigrant and what 'Home' means to me.
   * I was selected into the Almeida Young Leaders program. We studied and discussed what it means to be a young leader, and delivered recorded performances of our own written monologues.
   * I was one of 200 young people selected into the National Youth Theatre Youth Course in 2016. 5000 candidates auditioned that year.
   * I started making music and released my first project online. This was my first experience of creating and managing a long-term project on my own. It was a very valuable experience where I came up with a story for the project, wrote that into a plan, created marketing material and commissioned an artist to design my cover art, generated resources and a budget to produce and record my project, and rolled it out in my own local marketing campaign. These were all valuable and foundational experiences that have served me well in my career, and nurtured my interest in entrepreneurship and project + product management.

#### Any other qualifications

I've spent the last four years working in, and studying, effective Customer Service and Business practices. As part of my independent study, I've gained Foundation level qualifications in Prince2 Project Management, AgilePM, Business Analysis, and Change Management.

I excel at generating and/or expanding on ideas and scope for projects; creating effective project plans by utilising the appropriate frameworks, and then leading teams and delegating tasks throughout the project lifecycle; and regularly reviewing the project and adapting and/or pivoting when necessary, in order to deliver a relevant and robust project.

I've also studied Data Analysis and learned Excel and SQL to an advanced level, as well as Tableau to a novice level. I'm particularly interested in using Data to more effectively understand and serve customer needs and desires.

## Passion and Hobbies

I spend my time playing sports and enjoying the presence of my friends and family; meditating and doing Yoga; programming and building; making and sharing music; and reading/watching videos about life, (pragmatic) spirituality, relationships/emotional intelligence, sports and physiology, emerging trends, and leadership and communication; and most importantly - implementing them.

As you can probably tell, I'm passionate about learning, improving, and delivering. My motto is: "effective beliefs are more important than beliefs that are true". This absolutely does not mean that I think we should be untruthful, but just that the best way for me to genuinely understand life is by testing and experiencing myself, and sculpting my life - not by blindly believing ideas that don't hold up to reality testing. Still, I strongly believe that my way is not the only way to live, it's just one way. I respect others boundaries and choices and choose not to impose, but challenge my own self relentlessly (and healthily).

Above all, everything I do is in service of humanity. The reason I took up programming was to learn how to build products and systems myself and create genuinely valuable services for people around the world.
